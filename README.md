# SVM-TFIDF
This is a SVM model Trained on a TF-IDF vectorization of Data collected using this <a href="https://github.com/prgmlu/youm-7-scraping">script</a>

### Prerequisites
you need <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">sklearn library</a> for the train/test split, the TFIDF vectorization and for the SVM classifier
also pandas and numpy for loading data and passing it to the model.

```
pip3 install sklearn
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pandas
```
the code is self documented <a href="https://github.com/prgmlu/SVM-TFIDF/blob/master/SVM_TF-IDF.ipynb">here</a>
